An R package to extend the functionality of data.frame and data.frame-like 
objects with metadata and codebook annotations.

### Introduction

Metadata is not easily accessed and used in R and this is a big challenge to the
efforts to make data analysis more automated and more reproducible. This package
seeks to create a simple object-type for easily storing, updating, and
outputting metadata during the course of an analysis project. This way the
codebook can be baked right into the code.

### Overview

`metaframe` is organized around [a `meta.data` object][1]. This is an S4 object 
that stores lists of attributes for a data set. The package will also contain a 
small set of basic functions to package a `data.frame` and a `meta.data` object 
together, while  retaining the functionality of a `data.frame` with some additional 
enhancements. 


### Storing Metadata in R

`metaframe` organizes your `meta.data` into a few categories -- some of which it
can helpfully auto-complete for you.

### Example

Consider that we wish to document the `airquality` dataset built into R. After 
loading the dataset, you can call the `document` function to create a new object 
that contains the data, along with an attached `meta.data` attribute. 

```{r}
library(metaframe)
doco <- document(airquality)
class(doco)
```

The new documented object still behaves the way a `dataframe` would be expected 
to behave in R but with some additional information provided.

```{r}
summary(doco)
print(doco)
```


```{r}
print(attr(doco, "meta.data"))

```

## Adding Metadata

The basic metadata is not very helpful, just some basic numeric summaries
re-organized. The power of `metaframe` comes from the ability to add metadata
directly to the data object and to render that metadata out.

To do this, you can use a named list with names referring to the columns in the 
`metaframe` object.

```{r}
# Column labels

my_data_labels <- list("Ozone" = "numeric Ozone (ppb)")

```

```{r}
doco <- add_label(doco, label = my_data_labels)
add_source
add_note
add_unit
add_revision
```

[1]: The object is deliberately named with a period, `meta.data`, to avoid 
confusion when rendering HTML documents, mimic the formatting of `data.frame`, 
and to make searching for this specific implementation of metadata in R easier.
